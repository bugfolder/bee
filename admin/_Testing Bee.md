# Testing Bee

Bee's testing environment uses Lando, which is installed on my machine.

The Lando configuration is provided by the file `.lando/setup.sh` that is part of the Bee configuration.

You can debug Bee commands from the command line by launching PHPStorms for a Backdrop project, then running bee commands in that project.
