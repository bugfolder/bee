Notes

For development of Bee tests, we can develop and run tests locally putting commands under development into the DevTest.php file in this folder.

Then navigate to backdrop root of a working Backdrop installation, e.g.,

cd ~/Sites/backdrop/webroot

and run this command:

~/Sites/bee/phpunit --configuration ~/Sites/bee/admin/phpunit.xml --testsuite dev

Once the test is confirmed to work, it can be pasted into one of the existing Bee test suite commands or added as a new test file (appropriately named).

To run the regular bee tests (not multisite, though), run

~/Sites/bee/phpunit --configuration ~/Sites/bee/tests/phpunit.xml --testsuite backdrop

Note, the phpunit file in the bee folder is not part of the repo; it is downloaded separately and then gitignored.

This was (I think) the set of commands to download it:

cd ~/Sites/bee
wget -q --show-progress -O phpunit https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-8.5.phar
chmod +x phpunit

I must have downloaded it in the past since it's there now.
